						On the hunt for motors to continue our prototyping process, we made the drive over CA-17 to San Jose's premiere electronics, and hardware store, HSC. Unfortunately, we happened to make there the exact day that HSC was moving locations and as a result were closed. A quick tour around the other local area electronics shops, proved to end fruitlessily, and following some comforting In-n-Out burgers, and a heavy sigh we returned to Santa Cruz empty handed.<br><br>
						We once again turned to the Open Hand project and attempted to identify the parts that they used for their finger actuation. We found similar motors on Amazon that were gauranteed to ship Prime, and subitted the order. In the mean time we looked into different ideas of using the motor, ultimately deciding on a wire on a spool method. Upon recieving the motor in the mail, time was spent designing a fitting spool, and a mount that would hold the motor and guide our wire.<br><br>
						Eventually we were able to curl up one finger using the spool and motor mount we ordered and used. This is a huge result, as we have now verified our motion model, and can now progress further into the subject of specifics of the actuation model, and looking into sensors that we plan on using.<br><br>

					This week we installed and calibrated a new 3D printer in our lab space. The Ultimaker 2 is small table top printer that enables us to print PLA material prototypes. Building off of our design for foamcore, we estimated the needs we have for the PLA prototype.<br><br>
					We mocked up our designs in the SolidWorks and began printing. We had hiccups and we found limitations in our printing softare, but we now have 2 full PLA prototypes and are waiting for motors

						Following up another week of little physical manifestation of progress, we decided to start cracking on a physical prototype. After analyzing some models we found in our readings and discussing the advantages and short-comings of each design we moved forward and quickly built a prototype. The material used was quarter inch foam-core from which we fashioned 2 rings and a hand pad.<br><br>
						By running a thin wire from the Distal Phalanx (tip of the finger) down through the Proximal Phalanx (the bone that connects the finger to the palm), then through a pad that covered the palm, we were able to test the reaction on a relaxed finger that existed, when tugged on in this configuration. We found that this design was extremely successful as seen in the video:

						Having moved into the new lab, we spent the remainder of the week setting up our work stations and filling out paper work to make sure everyone had access to the tools and equipment we needed.Following another short conversation with our mentors and advisors we began to do an analysis of finger models and diffrent existing methods of actuating finger motion. We drew some inspiration from the <a href="http://openhandproject.org">Open Hand Project</a> as prosthetic limb movement tackles a similar subspace of mechanical actuation problems as we do.<br><br>
						We also came up with and framed our new logo! Introducing "MAGgy"!

						This week was our first back on campus. We met with our adivsors and spoke briefly on the direction that we want to see the project progress in. We acknowledge that we still have an extensive amount of research to accomplish before we really begin to grasp the problem at hand.<br><br>
						We spent most of the week look for documentation and academic research papers on topics pertaining to this project. It we agreed that this was to become an affordable everyday use system, not a reabilitative exercise machine, we also overviewed the demands this put on our system requirements.
